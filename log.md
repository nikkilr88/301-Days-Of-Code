# 301 Days Of Code - Log Round 1


### Day 149 (November 15, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the bootcamp. Currently working on the Flexbox section.

**Thoughts:**: Still not motivated #JustKeepSwimming.

### Day 146 - 148:

**Today's Progress**: Did a little reading and worked on bootcamp.

**Thoughts:**: Not really feeling motivated, but I'm pushing through. 

**Link to work:**: [Advanced WDB](https://github.com/nikkilr88/advanced-wdb)


### Day 145 (November 9, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Finished Practical JS, chapter two of [*Eloquent Javascript*](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and completed the exercises.

**Thoughts:**: There were three exercises at the end of the chapter. I completed them all without too much trouble, but I'm really not great at pattern printing. For the third exercise, we had to print a chess board. I got it working, but I put way too many if/else statements. I had a look at the source code and then refactored mine as needed.

Hopefully I'll get better at this with time. I'm really liking the book, though!

### Day 144 (November 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started the next section of the bootcamp, cleaned up my calculator code and did some refactoring.

### Day 143 (November 7, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp and started switching YelpCamp from Bootstrap 3 to 4.

**Thoughts:**: I'm liking the course so far. I'm exciting to start making fullstack one page apps.


### Day 141 & 142:

**Today's Progress**: Completed the bootcamp and started to refactor my FCC Simon game.

**Thoughts:**: Looking back, the Simon game doesn't seem that complicated. I remember when I was about to start coding it, I was so lost that I didn't even know where to start. This might be somewhat fun.

I'm also stoked about finally getting my cert! Now I'll have to check out Colt's advanced course!

### Day 138 - 140:

**Today's Progress**: Refactored Twitter bot and started the last section of The Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:**: I'm almost there! I really want to start Colt's advanced course once I complete this one. I also have to finish up Practical JS as well.


### Day 137 (October 30, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to The Web Developer Bootcamp. Styled the landing page and added dynamic price values.

**Thoughts:**: It's nice to get back to the bootcamp. I am almost done, so I just want to finish up. I tend to drift away from courses once I get near the end.


### Das 134 - 136:

**Today's Progress**: Twitter bot tweaks and a little FCC beta.

**Thoughts:**: I think I'm done with the bot for now. I do want to refactor it in the near future, though.


### Day 133 (October 24, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Twitter bot

**Thoughts:**: I think I am done for now. I want to move onto something else... Maybe get back to my bootcamp. I hope no more bugs pop up!


### Day 132 (October 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Did a little more work on the Twitter bot.

**Thoughts:**: I set it up to follow certain Youtubers who post their video tutorials. I tested it with my account and all went well. We'll see...

Yesterday I got in my 3+ minutes doing SoloLearn, but I still don't feel right counting it.


### Days 130 & 131:

**Today's Progress**: Socket.io, Google Maps API, built a basic Twitter bot.

**Thoughts:**: Kind of frustrated with the Google Maps API. Building the bot was pretty fun, though. I will have to add more to it one of these days.

**Link to work:** [Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/GitLit000)


### Day 129 (October 19, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: More Socket.io, Google Maps and Express.

**Thoughts:**: Things went better today. I think I might slowly be figuring this out. We'll see!


### Days 127 & 128:

**Today's Progress**: More work with socket.io and Google Maps API.

**Thoughts:**: Starting to get stressed out. Yes, I learn when I get stuck, but sometimes it doesn't feel like it's worth the trouble. :/  **Just Keep Swimming*\*


### Days 125 & 126:

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning socket.io. Also messed around with Leaflet and the Google Maps API.

**Thoughts:**: So far so good. I found some good tutorials on YouTube, so I think I have the basics down.


### Day 124 (October 14, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the bootcamp. Added flash messages to YelpCamp. Also tarted learning socket.io.

**Thoughts:**: Everything is going pretty well. Just have to keep it up.

**Thoughts:**: Getting back to it... Feels pretty good.

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Days 122 (October 10, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Completed one "learnyounode" exercise.

**Thoughts:**: I am starting to get bored with these lessons. I think I will enjoy them more when I get to express.


### Days 120 & 121:

**Today's Progress**: Lots of Express and some vanilla Node.

**Thoughts:**: Went back to FCC and worked on "learnyounode". Started and turned in "Request Header Parser Microservice".

Feeling okay. I really need to get back to my bootcamp soon, though.

**Link to work:** [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://dry-garden-19952.herokuapp.com/)


### Days 117-119:

**Today's Progress**: Enki, Bootstrap review and Git practice.

**Thoughts:**: Really struggling... Also having more computer problems, so that just adds to the stress.


### Day 116 (October 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Pair programming... Finished up "Pairwise". Also dabbled around with Express and Exceljs.

**Thoughts:**: Happy to put that algo behind me... At least for the moment. I will probably refactor it as I learn more.

### Day 116 (October 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Pair programming... Finished up "Pairwise". Also dabbled around with Express and Exceljs.

**Thoughts:**: Happy to put that algo behind me... At least for the moment. I will probably refactor it as I learn more.


### Day 115 (September 30, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Did a little algo work.

**Thoughts:**: Only got in about 10 minutes, and I know I only need to code 3 min 1 second per day, but I don't feel like I did anything.


### Day 114 (September 29, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Made my calculator app work offline and worked on algos.

**Thoughts:**: Making it work offline was easier than what I thought it would be. :)


### Days 111 - 113:

**Today's Progress**: Algos, algos and more algos.

**Thoughts:**: We finished up a couple of them, so that's a good feeling. I am going to have to get back to my bootcamp soon, though. I still have 40ish lessons to go. Slowly but surely...


### Days 109 - 110:

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little on the weather app and did some pair programming. Worked on FCC Smallest Common Multiple. https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/smallest-common-multiple

**Thoughts:**: The math for this algo kind of throws me off, but I think I am slowly understanding. Just learned about the Euclidean algorithm which has been very helpful.

### Day 108 (September 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the bootcamp! Added edit and update routes for YelpCamp comments. Did some work on the weather app as well.

**Thoughts:**: I have been struggling a lot recently, but I have to keep pushing through. I know I would regret it if I quit coding, so *Just Keep Swimming*.

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Days 105 - 107:

**Today's Progress**: Enki exercises and weather app

**Thoughts:**: I haven't been feeling motivated, and I still need to get back to doing my bootcamp. Going to try for tomorrow. 


### Day 104 (September 19, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the weather app

**Thoughts:**: Still working on adding in information. I might just redo the whole project with another API, though. We'll see.

Tomorrow I want to get back to Express and Mongo. I also need to finish up my bootcamp. 


### Day 103 (September 18, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the weather app.

**Thoughts:**: I started redoing it a while back, so I thought it would be fun to add to it. I'm still not great at design, so right now I am just adding in information.


### Day 102 (September 17, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Starting messing around with Chart.js

**Thoughts:**: It's easier than I thought it would be, but there are so many options. Thank god for Google.


### Day 101 (September 16, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the upvotes project. Did a lot of refactoring and styling.

**Thoughts:**: So far so good. I have been learning a lot with these little projects.


### Day 100 (September 15, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the upvotes project.

**Thoughts:**: I think I have most of the logic down. Now I need to figure out how to update the db without reloading the page. I did some research, and it looks like I can use ajax.

*Edit: I decided to work on it some more, and I figured it out thanks to Google. Ajax was the answer. I definitely have to learn more about it.*


### Day 99 (September 14, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the landing page and the upvotes project.

**Thoughts:**: I had to rewrite the logic for disabling buttons, but it's now working again. 

I think I'm almost done with the lading page. I still need to clean up the code and fix the features list, but it looks okay.

I also want to get back to the Web Dev Bootcamp. I have really been slacking on that.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://preview.c9users.io/nicolesattler/frontend-projects/twit-landing/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io)


### Day 98 (September 13, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the upvotes project.

**Thoughts:**: I'm slowly figuring things out. Right now I have the buttons disabling after the user clicks using localStorage. I also did some refactoring, so I think I am getting the hang of this.

I swear I coded on Monday (September 11), but for the life of me I cannot remember what I did. To be on the safe side, I'm not going to even bother counting it.


### Day 97 (September 10, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Express and Mongoose. I'm trying to figure out how to create a voting system.

**Thoughts:** I have the upvotes working, but I need a way to keep track of which items the user voted on. I don't want to create a whole login system. We'll see how this goes...


### Day 96 (September 9, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took it easy and did some lessons on my cell today. I leared about some useful CSS selectors.

**Thoughts:** Feeling meh, but keeping at it.


### Day 95 (September 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on the landing page.

**Thoughts:** Still feeling kind of sick, so I figured I would take it easy. I guess it's coming along well, but it still needs some work.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://preview.c9users.io/nicolesattler/frontend-projects/twit-landing/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io)


### Days 93 & 94:

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the bootcamp and learned about authorization. I also did some more work on the landing page and learned about how to set up a full stack app with React and Express from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting a little sick, so I'm having a hard time concentrating. *Just keep swimming...*


### Days 91 & 92:

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a landing page for FCC Beta and continued with the bootcamp. I added in edit, update and delete routes to YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:** I missed a few days, but I'm back. Feeling pretty good, so we'll see.


### Day 90 (August 31, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the slider. I refactored the code and broke everything up into seperate files, so now I can easily add it to other projects.

**Thoughts:** This slider doesn't actually slide. I started working on another one today that does, but I'm still figuring out how to control it using forward and back buttons.


### Days 88 & 89:

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the catalogue, website practice and started making a jQuery slider.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I have done the bootcamp, so I think tomorrow that's what I'll foucus on.

**Link to work:** [Content Slider](https://codepen.io/nikkilr88/full/oeJYrK/)


### Day 87 (August 28, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to working on my catalogue project in Express. I added in Mongoose and a seeds file to start off with. Did a lot of refactoring and started working on a cart. 

**Thoughts:** I'm still kind of uncomfortable with this, but that's how one improves, right?

**Link to work:** [Catalogue](https://github.com/nikkilr88/express-practice/tree/master/catalogue)


### Day 86 (August 26, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took it easy and worked on RegEx on freeCodeCamp beta.

**Thoughts:** I forgot most of what I had previously learned. These lessons seem pretty helpful, so we'll see.


### Day 85 (August 25, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little with React and started setting up my catalogue project in Express. 

**Thoughts:** React went well, but I was stuck for hours on the catalogue trying to get work as it did before. I couldn't figure out how to create a js variable with the data passed to the template.

I finally did it, though! Tomorrow I will try to connect it to a database. Now to relax the rest of the day. My brain is fried.

**Link to work:** [Catalogue](https://github.com/nikkilr88/express-practice/tree/master/catalogue)


### Day 84 (August 24, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Contined with the catalogue webpage. 

**Thoughts:** This would be a good project to do in Express. I think I might start setting it up tomorrow.


### Day 83 (August 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Lots of HTML, CSS and jQuery. Started working on a catalogue webpage for practice.

**Thoughts:** Design seems to be my weak point. I'll need to look around to see if I can find some good tips / lessons.


### Day 82 (August 22, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: ES6 and Flexbox on FreeCodeCamp beta.

**Thoughts:** So far the lessons are okay, but I really couldn't enjoy them because the website is very buggy on my old MacBook.


### Day 81 (August 21, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: More bootcamp today. I completed the user associations section and also refactored my blog project.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling, but today wasn't that bad. I am starting to feel like I am actually learning again. Now I think I will go back and review before moving forward.

**Link to work**: [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Day 80 (August 20, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Finished the PHP course on SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** I like that I can study when I'm not by my computer, but I think I learn more by doing. Reading and doing "fill in the blanks" really isn't my thing.


### Day 79 (August 18, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the bootcamp. Refactored YelpCamp routes and also associated users with comments.

**Thoughts:** I'm still having a hard time finding motivation. I just have to keep at it. I think I am going to be doing a lot of review.

**Link to work**: [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Days 76 - 78:

**Today's Progress**: Continued with auth review, started dabbling with Meteor.js and completed "Exact Change" on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how I feel about Meteor just yet. I think I am going to finish the project I started and then put it off to the side. I think I am getting better at algos, though.

**Link to work**: [Exact Change](https://repl.it/KM1I/34)


### Day 75 (August 12, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the bootcamp. Continued reviewing auth and started dabbling with Meteor.js.

**Thoughts:** Maybe one day I'll have all of this auth stuff down.


### Day 74 (August 14, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML, CSS and jQuery. Played around with making a tattoo gallery.

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting my motivation back, but I'm still not 100% feeling it yet.


### Day 73 (August 12, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the API projects and also redid "Inventory Update"

**Thoughts:** It was a pretty good day. I want to get back to my course, though.


### Day 72 (August 11, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked with a friend on some API projects.

**Thoughts:** It was pretty good review. I'm glad I was able to remember everything I had learned on FCC.


### Day 71 (August 10, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started the auth section of the bootcamp again and worked on my React Recipe Box project.

**Thoughts:** Overall, it was a decent day. I'm still not feeling very motivated, but I did get in a few hours of coding.

**Link to work**: [Recipe Box](https://github.com/nikkilr88/fcc-recipe-box/tree/develop)


### Day 70 (August 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Followed through and worked on the bootcamp today. Finished up with the second auth section.

**Thoughts:** I am going to go back and review both auth sections before moving forward with the course.


### Day 69 (August 7, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Still taking a break from the bootcamp. I practiced making websites today.

**Thoughts:** I can tell that I'm slowly improving, but I'm still not feeling very motivated. It's also been a few days since I have worked on the bootcamp. My goal for tomorrow is to focus on Express.

### Day 68 (August 6, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Decided to go back to FCC and work on algos. Finished "Inventory Update". Now I just have to clean it up a bit.

**Thoughts:** It was a nice to get back to working on algos. I never thought they would be useful, but they have actually helped me out a ton.

**Link to work**: [Inventory Update](https://repl.it/JzAY/7)


### Day 67 (August 5, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the bootcamp today. Had to watch a tutorial to finish the slider, but it's done for the most part. I also dabbled with the FB Graph API. I finally figured out how to pull album photos from a FB page to display on a website.

**Thoughts:** Just keep swimming.

**Link to work**: [Testimonial Slider](https://codepen.io/nikkilr88/full/oeYVpK/)


### Day 66 (August 4, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the bootcamp and added a login page and logic. Also dabbled with jQuery and started making a testimonial slider.

**Thoughts:** Not feeling very motivated but pushing through.


### Day 65 (August 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Added authentication to YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:** Had a crappy past couple of days, but I'm back at it. 


### Day 64 (July 31, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued the bootcamp and finished the Secret Page code along. I also did some work on the movie app and added in comments.

**Thoughts:** I am going to have to review the into to authentication one or two more times before it sticks. I'm excited about the comments on the movie app, though. I thought it was going to be more difficult because the movie info is comming from an API while the comments are coming from mongo.

**Link to work**: [Movie App](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-movie-app/tree/develop)


### Day 63 (July 30, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started a YouTube course called ["PHP Front To Back"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), started working on form validation.

**Thoughts:** I don't care for PHP much, but I think it might be useful for me to learn.


### Day 62 (July 29, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued the bootcamp. Finished up with the comments and started learning about authentication! I also did a little bit of work on the movie app and the RESTful routing blog app.

**Thoughts:** All of the information is a little overwhelming. I am probably going to review these lessons before moving forward. I think I have RESTful routing down, though. 

**Link to work**: [Secret Page](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/Authentication/SecretPage)


### Day 61 (July 28, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Focued on the boot camp today. Added comments to "YelpCamp" and started to redo the blog project.

**Thoughts:** Recently there has been a lot of information to take in. I'm trying to take it easy so it all sticks.


### Day 60 (July 27, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my portfolio today. I think it's coming along nicely. I also completed the "Data Associations" section of the web dev bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I really can't complain. I can tell that I am making progress! My goal for tomorrow is to forget about my portfolio and focus on the bootcamp.

**Link to work**: [Portfolio](https://github.com/nikkilr88/portfoliov3)


### Day 59 (July 26, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the bootcamp to work on my portfolio. Lots of refactoring today.

**Thoughts:** It has been a long day. I put a lot of time into it, but not much has changed. It's slowly looking better, though.


### Day 58 (July 25, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the blog project and the RESTful Routing section of the bootcamp. I hope to improve on it after learning some more and redo my portfoilio in Express. I also completed 1 "learnyounode" FCC challenge.

**Thoughts:** I had fun with this section. I think I am going to call it a day, though. It was a lot to take in, and I don't want to stress myself out. I will probably work through this section again and try to build something similar on my own.

**Link to work**: [RESTful Blog App](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/RESTfulRouting/BlogApp)


### Day 57 (July 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any real studying today. I did do some tutorials and played around with Bootstrap 4, though. I didn't know they had a carousel component!

**Thoughts:** I have an itch to redo my portfolio again. I really should study design, or at least pratice cloning webpages.

**Link to work**: [Weight Converter](https://codepen.io/nikkilr88/full/MvWaXG/) 


### Day 56 (July 22, 2017):

### Day 52 (July 18, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Git and React today. Learned about branches in Git and applied what I learned to make a development branch in my recipe box project. I also started working on the edit function... I am getting closer.

**Thoughts:** The more I learn about Git, the more I love it.

**Link to work**: [Recipe Box](https://github.com/nikkilr88/fcc-recipe-box/tree/develop)


### Day 51 (July 17, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Had to take a break from the bootcamp to start working on a website. Hopefully this will be a paid project.

**Thoughts:** It was nice to work with html and css, but I want to get back to my course.


### Day 46 (July 11, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the bootcamp. Finished the Patatap clone project and started the backend section of the course!
