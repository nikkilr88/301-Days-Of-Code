# 301 Days Of Code - Log Round 1


### Day 116 (October 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Pair programming... Finished up "Pairwise". Also dabbled around with Express and Exceljs.

**Thoughts:**: Happy to put that algo behind me... At least for the moment. I will probably refactor it as I learn more.


### Day 115 (September 30, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Did a little algo work.

**Thoughts:**: Only got in about 10 minutes, and I know I only need to code 3 min 1 second per day, but I don't feel like I did anything.


### Day 114 (September 29, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Made my calculator app work offline and worked on algos.

**Thoughts:**: Making it work offline was easier than what I thought it would be. :)


### Days 111 - 113:

**Today's Progress**: Algos, algos and more algos.

**Thoughts:**: We finished up a couple of them, so that's a good feeling. I am going to have to get back to my bootcamp soon, though. I still have 40ish lessons to go. Slowly but surely...


### Days 109 - 110:

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little on the weather app and did some pair programming. Worked on FCC Smallest Common Multiple. https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/smallest-common-multiple

**Thoughts:**: The math for this algo kind of throws me off, but I think I am slowly understanding. Just learned about the Euclidean algorithm which has been very helpful.

### Day 108 (September 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the bootcamp! Added edit and update routes for YelpCamp comments. Did some work on the weather app as well.

**Thoughts:**: I have been struggling a lot recently, but I have to keep pushing through. I know I would regret it if I quit coding, so *Just Keep Swimming*.

**Link to work:** [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Days 105 - 107:

**Today's Progress**: Enki exercises and weather app

**Thoughts:**: I haven't been feeling motivated, and I still need to get back to doing my bootcamp. Going to try for tomorrow. 


### Day 104 (September 19, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the weather app

**Thoughts:**: Still working on adding in information. I might just redo the whole project with another API, though. We'll see.

Tomorrow I want to get back to Express and Mongo. I also need to finish up my bootcamp. 


### Day 103 (September 18, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the weather app.

**Thoughts:**: I started redoing it a while back, so I thought it would be fun to add to it. I'm still not great at design, so right now I am just adding in information.


### Day 102 (September 17, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Starting messing around with Chart.js

**Thoughts:**: It's easier than I thought it would be, but there are so many options. Thank god for Google.


### Day 101 (September 16, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the upvotes project. Did a lot of refactoring and styling.

**Thoughts:**: So far so good. I have been learning a lot with these little projects.


### Day 100 (September 15, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the upvotes project.

**Thoughts:**: I think I have most of the logic down. Now I need to figure out how to update the db without reloading the page. I did some research, and it looks like I can use ajax.

*Edit: I decided to work on it some more, and I figured it out thanks to Google. Ajax was the answer. I definitely have to learn more about it.*


### Day 99 (September 14, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the landing page and the upvotes project.

**Thoughts:**: I had to rewrite the logic for disabling buttons, but it's now working again. 

I think I'm almost done with the lading page. I still need to clean up the code and fix the features list, but it looks okay.

I also want to get back to the Web Dev Bootcamp. I have really been slacking on that.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://preview.c9users.io/nicolesattler/frontend-projects/twit-landing/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io)


### Day 98 (September 13, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the upvotes project.

**Thoughts:**: I'm slowly figuring things out. Right now I have the buttons disabling after the user clicks using localStorage. I also did some refactoring, so I think I am getting the hang of this.

I swear I coded on Monday (September 11), but for the life of me I cannot remember what I did. To be on the safe side, I'm not going to even bother counting it.


### Day 97 (September 10, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Express and Mongoose. I'm trying to figure out how to create a voting system.

**Thoughts:** I have the upvotes working, but I need a way to keep track of which items the user voted on. I don't want to create a whole login system. We'll see how this goes...


### Day 96 (September 9, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took it easy and did some lessons on my cell today. I leared about some useful CSS selectors.

**Thoughts:** Feeling meh, but keeping at it.


### Day 95 (September 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on the landing page.

**Thoughts:** Still feeling kind of sick, so I figured I would take it easy. I guess it's coming along well, but it still needs some work.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://preview.c9users.io/nicolesattler/frontend-projects/twit-landing/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io)


### Days 93 & 94:

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the bootcamp and learned about authorization. I also did some more work on the landing page and learned about how to set up a full stack app with React and Express from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting a little sick, so I'm having a hard time concentrating. *Just keep swimming...*


### Days 91 & 92:

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a landing page for FCC Beta and continued with the bootcamp. I added in edit, update and delete routes to YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:** I missed a few days, but I'm back. Feeling pretty good, so we'll see.


### Day 90 (August 31, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the slider. I refactored the code and broke everything up into seperate files, so now I can easily add it to other projects.

**Thoughts:** This slider doesn't actually slide. I started working on another one today that does, but I'm still figuring out how to control it using forward and back buttons.


### Days 88 & 89:

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the catalogue, website practice and started making a jQuery slider.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I have done the bootcamp, so I think tomorrow that's what I'll foucus on.

**Link to work:** [Content Slider](https://codepen.io/nikkilr88/full/oeJYrK/)


### Day 87 (August 28, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to working on my catalogue project in Express. I added in Mongoose and a seeds file to start off with. Did a lot of refactoring and started working on a cart. 

**Thoughts:** I'm still kind of uncomfortable with this, but that's how one improves, right?

**Link to work:** [Catalogue](https://github.com/nikkilr88/express-practice/tree/master/catalogue)


### Day 86 (August 26, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took it easy and worked on RegEx on freeCodeCamp beta.

**Thoughts:** I forgot most of what I had previously learned. These lessons seem pretty helpful, so we'll see.


### Day 85 (August 25, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked a little with React and started setting up my catalogue project in Express. 

**Thoughts:** React went well, but I was stuck for hours on the catalogue trying to get work as it did before. I couldn't figure out how to create a js variable with the data passed to the template.

I finally did it, though! Tomorrow I will try to connect it to a database. Now to relax the rest of the day. My brain is fried.

**Link to work:** [Catalogue](https://github.com/nikkilr88/express-practice/tree/master/catalogue)


### Day 84 (August 24, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Contined with the catalogue webpage. 

**Thoughts:** This would be a good project to do in Express. I think I might start setting it up tomorrow.


### Day 83 (August 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Lots of HTML, CSS and jQuery. Started working on a catalogue webpage for practice.

**Thoughts:** Design seems to be my weak point. I'll need to look around to see if I can find some good tips / lessons.


### Day 82 (August 22, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: ES6 and Flexbox on FreeCodeCamp beta.

**Thoughts:** So far the lessons are okay, but I really couldn't enjoy them because the website is very buggy on my old MacBook.


### Day 81 (August 21, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: More bootcamp today. I completed the user associations section and also refactored my blog project.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling, but today wasn't that bad. I am starting to feel like I am actually learning again. Now I think I will go back and review before moving forward.

**Link to work**: [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Day 80 (August 20, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Finished the PHP course on SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** I like that I can study when I'm not by my computer, but I think I learn more by doing. Reading and doing "fill in the blanks" really isn't my thing.


### Day 79 (August 18, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the bootcamp. Refactored YelpCamp routes and also associated users with comments.

**Thoughts:** I'm still having a hard time finding motivation. I just have to keep at it. I think I am going to be doing a lot of review.

**Link to work**: [YelpCamp](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/YelpCamp)


### Days 76 - 78:

**Today's Progress**: Continued with auth review, started dabbling with Meteor.js and completed "Exact Change" on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how I feel about Meteor just yet. I think I am going to finish the project I started and then put it off to the side. I think I am getting better at algos, though.

**Link to work**: [Exact Change](https://repl.it/KM1I/34)


### Day 75 (August 12, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the bootcamp. Continued reviewing auth and started dabbling with Meteor.js.

**Thoughts:** Maybe one day I'll have all of this auth stuff down.


### Day 74 (August 14, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML, CSS and jQuery. Played around with making a tattoo gallery.

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting my motivation back, but I'm still not 100% feeling it yet.


### Day 73 (August 12, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the API projects and also redid "Inventory Update"

**Thoughts:** It was a pretty good day. I want to get back to my course, though.


### Day 72 (August 11, 2017):

**Thoughts:** It was pretty good review. I'm glad I was able to remember everything I had learned on FCC.


### Day 71 (August 10, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started the auth section of the bootcamp again and worked on my React Recipe Box project.

**Thoughts:** Overall, it was a decent day. I'm still not feeling very motivated, but I did get in a few hours of coding.

**Link to work**: [Recipe Box](https://github.com/nikkilr88/fcc-recipe-box/tree/develop)


### Day 70 (August 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Followed through and worked on the bootcamp today. Finished up with the second auth section.

**Thoughts:** I am going to go back and review both auth sections before moving forward with the course.


### Day 69 (August 7, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Still taking a break from the bootcamp. I practiced making websites today.

**Thoughts:** I can tell that I'm slowly improving, but I'm still not feeling very motivated. It's also been a few days since I have worked on the bootcamp. My goal for tomorrow is to focus on Express.

### Day 68 (August 6, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Decided to go back to FCC and work on algos. Finished "Inventory Update". Now I just have to clean it up a bit.

**Thoughts:** It was a nice to get back to working on algos. I never thought they would be useful, but they have actually helped me out a ton.

**Link to work**: [Inventory Update](https://repl.it/JzAY/7)


### Day 67 (August 5, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the bootcamp today. Had to watch a tutorial to finish the slider, but it's done for the most part. I also dabbled with the FB Graph API. I finally figured out how to pull album photos from a FB page to display on a website.

**Thoughts:** Just keep swimming.

### Day 66 (August 4, 2017):

**Thoughts:** Not feeling very motivated but pushing through.


### Day 65 (August 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Added authentication to YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:** Had a crappy past couple of days, but I'm back at it. 


### Day 64 (July 31, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued the bootcamp and finished the Secret Page code along. I also did some work on the movie app and added in comments.

**Thoughts:** I am going to have to review the into to authentication one or two more times before it sticks. I'm excited about the comments on the movie app, though. I thought it was going to be more difficult because the movie info is comming from an API while the comments are coming from mongo.

**Link to work**: [Movie App](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-movie-app/tree/develop)


### Day 63 (July 30, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started a YouTube course called ["PHP Front To Back"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn), started working on form validation.

**Thoughts:** I don't care for PHP much, but I think it might be useful for me to learn.


### Day 62 (July 29, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued the bootcamp. Finished up with the comments and started learning about authentication! I also did a little bit of work on the movie app and the RESTful routing blog app.

**Thoughts:** All of the information is a little overwhelming. I am probably going to review these lessons before moving forward. I think I have RESTful routing down, though. 

**Link to work**: [Secret Page](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/Authentication/SecretPage)


### Day 61 (July 28, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Focued on the boot camp today. Added comments to "YelpCamp" and started to redo the blog project.

**Thoughts:** Recently there has been a lot of information to take in. I'm trying to take it easy so it all sticks.


### Day 60 (July 27, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my portfolio today. I think it's coming along nicely. I also completed the "Data Associations" section of the web dev bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I really can't complain. I can tell that I am making progress! My goal for tomorrow is to forget about my portfolio and focus on the bootcamp.

### Day 59 (July 26, 2017):

### Day 58 (July 25, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the blog project and the RESTful Routing section of the bootcamp. I hope to improve on it after learning some more and redo my portfoilio in Express. I also completed 1 "learnyounode" FCC challenge.

**Thoughts:** I had fun with this section. I think I am going to call it a day, though. It was a lot to take in, and I don't want to stress myself out. I will probably work through this section again and try to build something similar on my own.

**Link to work**: [RESTful Blog App](https://github.com/nikkilr88/wdb-backend/tree/master/RESTfulRouting/BlogApp)


### Day 57 (July 23, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any real studying today. I did do some tutorials and played around with Bootstrap 4, though. I didn't know they had a carousel component!

**Thoughts:** I have an itch to redo my portfolio again. I really should study design, or at least pratice cloning webpages.

### Day 56 (July 22, 2017):

### Day 52 (July 18, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Git and React today. Learned about branches in Git and applied what I learned to make a development branch in my recipe box project. I also started working on the edit function... I am getting closer.

**Thoughts:** The more I learn about Git, the more I love it.

**Today's Progress**: Had to take a break from the bootcamp to start working on a website. Hopefully this will be a paid project.

**Thoughts:** Still not feeling motivated, but I'm pushing through.

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the webpage, made it to Unit 13 of "The Web Developer Bootcamp" and completed one advanced alorithm on FCC.

### Day 27 (June 19, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp" & Codecademy "ReactJS: Part II".

**Thoughts:** Today has been better than the last few days. I'm trying to take it easy for a while and do lots of lessons and course work before continuing on with any big projects. Sometimes I push myself too much and lose motivation, so my focus is going to be on studying for a while.

### Day 26 (June 17, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Focused on ReactJS. Tried to get some work done on the recipe box project for FCC, but nothing seemed to click and I struggled a lot. With some help, I mananged to make a little progress and got the recipes on screen without DOM manipulation. I decided to quit while I was ahead.

**Thoughts:** It was a pretty stressful day. I know when I get like this I end up learning a lot, so I am going to try to be positive.

### Day 25 (June 16, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp", worked a little with ReactJS and AngularJS.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not feeling very motivated. I don't feel like I am making any real progress.

### Day 24 (June 15, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Started the JavaScript section and did a few assignments. Had a lot of problems with Git today. Almost lost somre projects. I also made a very basic admin login/logout system in PHP.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed because of Git. I figured everything out but ended up losing a lot motivation.

**Today's Progress**: Continued "The Web Developer Bootcamp". Finished the last Bootstrap project, so I'll finally be moving on to the JS section.

**Thoughts:** Got a late start today, but still got in a good amount of coding. I'm feeling like I need to be making more progress. We'll see...

**Today's Progress**: Continued with "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course and worked a little on the Google homepage project.

**Thoughts:** Feeling positive. I really think I am going to learn a lot with this course.


### Day 18 (June 8, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Continued with "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course and did a little work with React. Feels a bit slow, but I'm still learning things I didn't know before. I'm excited about the upcoming Bootstamp and JS sections!

**Thoughts:** Had a good day. It will feel nice to get back to some bigger projects, though.

### Day 17 (June 7, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Giphy app. Added a "load more" button. Started "The Web Developer Bootcamp" Udemy course.

### Day 16 (June 6, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Decided to take it easy today. Made a tabbed panel, watched tutorials on YouTube, worked on the Google homepage project for The Odin Project and did interactive ReactJS lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good. It was nice to go back to the basics and just have some fun.

### Day 15 (June 5, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Started doing The Odin Project again. I got a start on the Google homepage project. Learned how to do vertical positioning without flexbox. I'm also getting better with Git.

**Thoughts:** Feeling meh. Looked at one of my older projects in IE, and saw that flexbox wasn't working correctly even with the prefixes. It was kind of frustrating because I could not fix it. It might be a bug, though. I saw others with the same problem.

### Day 14 (June 3, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Giphy API on my React Local weather project. Made some progress with both. I'm just not sure if I like how the Giphy web app is coming along.

**Thoughts:** Feeling better today. I am going to rest for the rest of the day so I don't get stressed.

### Day 13 (June 2, 2017):

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today. Worked with some HTML and CSS. Set up a basic ReactJS project to start redoing my local weather app. I ran into a lot of issues, but eventually I got it working with some help.

**Thoughts:** Kind of stressed out about all of the issues I am having. Today was one of those "Maybe this isn't for me" days today.

### Days 1-12:

**Today's Progress**: Started to really learn Git. Deployed my first ReactJS project.

**Thoughts:** I was really stressed out up until today. After getting some help, things are making more sense. So far, this has been a good learning process. I feel kind of bad for not logging the first 11 days!
